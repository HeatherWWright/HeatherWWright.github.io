Hello! My name is Heather Wright and this is my first semester in the ISLT program. I teach 5th grade in St. Louis, MO. I have utterly no experience in web application or development!  This is the first time I have ever intentionally interacted with code beyond playing in Scratch with my elementary students. I am pretty sure they had a better understanding of what we were doing than I ever did. The expectations that I have for myself in this course is to grow my confidence and understanding of basic web development.  I am very interested in growing my skills in order to apply them in education.  In my free time, I love playing video games with my family and friends, playing with my dog Cosmo, reading, and traveling. I am also a huge Star Wars fan and collect a lot of Star Wars memorabilia.
