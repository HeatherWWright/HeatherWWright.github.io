                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> My name is Heather Wright and I am a 5th grade teacher at Independence Elementary.  I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education with a minor in Literacy. I am certified to teach elementary grades 1-6 in Missouri state.  I am a candidate for the Learning Technologies and Design masters program through the University of Missouri Online with an anticipated graduation date in the summer of 2025. 
                    <br> I am happily married to my husband David. We have 3 beautiful children, a dog named Cosmo, and 3 tortoises; Baby, Ted The Hero, and Das Machine. I love reading, traveling, and playing video games.<br>
