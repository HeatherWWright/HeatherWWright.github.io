                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> My name is Heather Wright and I am a current student at the University of Missouri enrolled in the Learning Technologies and Design Masters program with an emphasis in education.  My projected graduation date is in the Spring of 2025. I completed my undergraduate degree at Missouri State University with a Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education with a concentration in Literacy.
                    <br> I am a certified elementary school teacher for grades one through six.  I am a lifelong learner who loves to share my joy and passion for learning with my students.  I currently teach 5th grade at Independence Elementary with the most amazing scholars!  I have taught in the Francis Howell School District and The Hazelwood School District.  I have also completed a year-long internship in the Clayton School District.  I am happily married to my best friend David and we have 3 beautiful and amazing children together!
